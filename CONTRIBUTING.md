# How to report a bug
> Remember，if you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue -- malicious attackers can exploit it. Email 
> support@featureprobe.com instead.

> In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
> * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
> * Can I disable something for other people?
>
> If the answer to either of those two questions is "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at security@featureprobe.com.

### How to file a bug report
> When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
>
> 1. What FeatureProbe version are you using? 
> 2. What coding language and version are you using? (For example, Java 1.8)
> 3. What did you do?
> 4. What did you expect to see?
> 5. What did you see instead?

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

## Our long term plans

> We are constantly working to provide more language-specific SDKs, more features, and higher stability and performance.

## How to suggest a feature

Many of the features that FeatureProbe has today have been added because 
our users saw the need. If you would like to suggest a new feature, open an issue on our issues list on GitHub.
Please describe the feature you have in mind, why you need it, and how it should work.
